### **Coding Guidelines**

TypeScript: [https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html)  
We chose the Google style guide for TypeScript because it’s close to an industry standard that’s used by many. This style guide has a strong emphasis on the consistent naming conventions and readability which will help with React Native. We will be enforcing this by using ESLint with TypeScript rules.

React native: [https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/)  
We chose this React style guide because it follows modern React practices like using functional components and hooks, which helps us write scalable, organized code that’s easy to build on later. We will enforce this with ESLint along with the Airbnb configuration.
