## Progress and issues: 

#### **UI/UX:**

Aliyah: This week I focused on the frontend since my portion didn’t require UI.

Lillian: This week I focused on frontend’s tasks. 

Vicky: This week, I focused on mainly the frontend tasks too, but before this Friday, I’ll be working on revising the user manual documentation. 

#### **Frontend:**

Aliyah: This week, I finished the confirmation flow for adding songs from party mode to your saved playlists. It was a pretty smooth feature to add since I just had to build upon the party mode feature and the saved playlist feature that were already in use.

Lillian: This week I finished the toggle feature for the party sessions. I had to code a place holder since my implementation later builds off of other members’ work. This made me worried with how much I would have to change later on. But in the end I just focused on one playlist’s toggle. I also made small changes so that the session code fits on the same line with the other playlist information.  

Vicky: This week I finished the party mode buttons to activate either host party or join party, as well as generating the 6 digit code and syncing across all screens. However, currently, I still need to connect all pieces of the later screens together and also the backend endpoints before the end of Friday. Right now, we don’t have any merge conflicts with main, but I’m still trying to fix all the tiny bugs within the app that’s reported on GitHub Issues this week. What I learned too is that you can connect your issues with your pull request so when it closes, it’ll also automatically close the GitHub Issue request. 

#### **Backend:**

Zack: This week I researched transaction support in Supabase for the party mode backend. I discovered that Supabase's JavaScript client doesn't natively support transactions, so we'll need to use SQL commands directly (via RPC functions or direct queries) to ensure atomic operations when multiple users join parties and add songs. I also worked on backend tests this week and submitted a pull request for review. I'm continuing work on the database schema modifications for party codes.

Louis: This week I primarily focussed on fixing bugs we had in the github issues, either coming from our team or from the peer review. For example, there was a bug coming from a wrong encoding of the title song, which replaced the space character by its ascii encoding instead of a ‘+’ character in the url. Another bug was the playlist detail which wasn’t updated when we added new songs. I also started to work on backend endpoints for the party mode, but didn’t finish them. I had to read a lot of code this week to try and identify where the bugs were coming from, but I didn’t struggle a lot.

Ava: This week I primarily worked on hammering out YouTube Music export further as well as smoothing out some of the surprise errors from our Spotify export that occurred when backend and frontend were merged. The main issues I had were navigating Google’s Developer Cloud Console and implementing the OAuth for YouTube export. Google doesn’t allow custom redirect URI schemes so I had to go about implementing YouTube export differently than I had done with Spotify, since I created custom redirect schemes for that. I hope that YouTube export can be tested by other members as we have work sessions later in the week to hopefully catch any remaining bugs and errors with the implementation.
