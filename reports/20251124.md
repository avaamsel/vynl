## Progress and issues: 

#### **UI/UX:**

Aliyah: I didn’t do any UI work this week since my part of the frontend didn’t need new or updated screens.

Lillian: This week I finished up the wireframe for my portion of the party feature which was just the toggle on/off and playlist tags. The tags UI was simple since it’s similar to how other apps filter things. The toggle on/off was very straightforward for the same reason. It was also simple since I’m just adding onto pre-existing frames. 

Vicky: I finished up revising the wireframes in terms of the joining or hosting the party playlist and refining how the user would add the six digit code. I also revised the user manual based on the GitHub Issues from last week and added a new Troubleshooting/FAQ section for common errors people run into such as forgetting to request the environmental files from one of the team members or getting error message when it’s on Windows vs Mac in the set up stage. 

#### **Frontend:**

Aliyah: This week, I worked on fixing GitHub issues for our developer guide to make it clearer and easier to follow. What went well was cleaning up the small clarity issues I could fix those fast. 

Lillian: This week I worked on implementing the UI for the party mode feature. I worked on the toggle on/off and playlist tags. Implementing the tags weren’t too hard since I just needed to add them underneath the pre-existing playlist information. I’m finishing up the toggle feature which I think is more difficult since I have to consider how it’s connected to backend. 

Vicky: This week, I worked on the frontend implementation of the buttons to ‘host a party playlist’ and ‘join a party playlist’ on the party mode button in the main dashboard. However, I’m running into issues with all the merge conflicts happening this week because everyone is working on different branches, when I try to approve pull requests, I’m spending a little time longer than expected to figure out the latest package.json file that’s needed for all features to work. In addition, I’m struggling a little on figuring out how to sync the code generation across all screens as well as if I should store the code locally on AsyncStorage or on Supabase for people to access during party mode. 

#### **Backend:**

Zack: I was able to finish the backend tests however it took much longer than I originally thought. I ran into many problems with synchronization of test and client sessions. I was able to fix all those problems and now adding tests to the backend should be pretty straightforward to just use the helper functions laid out in the testing files. I helped in some minor ways to finish the frontend backend merge, but most of my time was spent making the tests. Additionally I did not get the API documentation for the new endpoints made yet.

Louis: This week I mainly worked on finishing connecting the front and backend. I made the link with the playlists page and the playlist detail page and ran into many bugs which were due to inconsistent states and bad saves, but I managed to fix it. I also worked on fixing many issues we had, mainly in the selection section with the problem of linking correctly data coming from two different API’s (lastfm and itunes) which had different attributes and weren’t always available in both. Finally, I worked on the song preview during the swiping process. I learned a lot about the states and how async storage was used since I had to fix a lot of problems coming from there.

Ava: This week I resolved some minor errors with my Spotify export implementation after working closely with Vicky as well as implemented a YouTube Music export prototype that has been able to export a playlist to my youtube account. I had some issues setting up some of the YouTube Music endpoints as well as general user authentication, to which I went with browser authentication. In general I learned how to navigate and use Google’s Developer tools and get them connected to a project.
