Louis: 

* General : Re-work the project structure depending on the feedback we get on the software design assignment. Make sure the authentication works correctly for login/signup with Supabase. (2 days)

Zack: 

* Finish working on the file structure of the app, make sure the expo router is working properly and configured. (2 hours)

* Finalize (for now) database schema and add it to Supabase. (2 day)

## Progress and issues: 

#### **UI/UX:**

Aliyah: I mainly focused on ensuring the frontend screens we currently have implemented were a direct match to what we as UI/UX expected. I learned the importance of understanding the user's navigation path when it comes to developing ideas for ui/ux and how design plays a role in this aspect. When you understand the user's navigation habits it allows you to create a seamless user experience. My goals are now focusing on creating the export page screen, where users can export their matched playlists to different music streaming platforms. As well as finalizing the swiping screens after receiving feedback from the frontend and backend\!

Lillian: This week I focused on implementing the UI with frontend. We needed to have one functional use case so I shifted my focus to implementing the upload feature. I revised how our upload feature would flow. Initially, we had more frames than needed. I struggled with finalizing the icons and overall look of the upload feature. I came up with the solution to have a pop up background when the user chooses songs. After I finish up implementing the upload feature, I can work on the export page screens.

Vicky: This week, I focused mainly on designing the dashboard interface so frontend could start implementing it. I couldn’t complete designing the export flow as I had hoped because this week I joined the frontend team to help implement the dashboard, given that the beta release is due in a week, and we haven’t completed an entire user flow on the app yet. The main struggle this week was getting our desirable font installed on Figma, which we couldn’t but the frontend was able to install it and successfully shows it in the app. My goal for this upcoming week is to finish designing the export flow before Thursday night so frontend can start implementing it Friday. What I learned this week is thinking more in depth about the user experience in terms of should the login screen appear first or should the user try the features of the app first and then sign up later to save their playlist? These questions helped me better understand what it’s like to work as an UI/UX designer.

#### **Frontend:**

Aliyah: I built the sign-up and login option page where users can choose which one they are doing, but right now there's a problem \- when someone tries to sign up or log in, the app doesn't actually check if their information is correct or remember that they're logged in, so the authentication system needs to be made it actually work. I'm currently building the part where users can upload songs with a search box where you can type in an artist name or song title, find the song you want, and then it gets saved to the database. After that, I need to make the main dashboard where users will see songs pop up and swipe on them.

Lillian: This week I implemented the upload songs feature. There was already an upload page placeholder. I changed the background into a gradient one which meant downloading the a gradient package from expo. I have not perfected the gradient to be an exact match with the Figma version. I also changed the fonts to match the UI. This went pretty smoothly. I learned how to use a search input which is used for searching songs. I just need to add a search button icon inside the search bar. I need to fix the songs that show up when the user is first directed to uploading songs. It’s showing songs before the user searches something but this should be a simple fix. 

Vicky: This week, I focused on implementing the main dashboard landing page for the app. I struggled with setting up expo initially because there was some pre-configuration steps. However, because I was the last one in my team to set it up, it helped our team know what other details we need to include in our developer guide later to avoid this in the future. I learned how to create a dashboard page that links to other pages, how to work simultaneously with others developers and avoid merge conflicts. I’m still stuck on how the user’s stats should be implemented on the main screen, but it’s a stretch goal, the UI/UX and backend will focus on later.


#### **Backend:**

Zack: 

* Finished working on the file structure of the app. Helped fix any expo router bugs with others running the code.  
* Realized we did not need user auth flow backend endpoints and was able to set up user auth flow on the frontend.  
* Worked with Louis to finalize database schema  
* Started on User APIs

Louis: This week I decided to focus on only the backend to help with the api logic and the recommendation of songs, as well as the preview. Therefore I didn’t implement any major things in frontend. For the backend, I finalized working on the database schema to have a logical structure. I also thought a lot about the recommendation logic, because Deezer API doesn’t work (in fact it has been down since a little time). With the backend team, we all brainstormed about what alternatives we could use. We concluded that the best was to use [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) api for recommendation, and iTunes for searching songs and getting the sound previews. Unfortunately we didn’t find any public, free and legal resource allowing us to get enough information such as BPM, key and genre to compute a similarity score by ourselves. I implemented the recommendation algorithm with [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) which takes basically a number n of recommended songs for each seed song, and then selects in priority the songs appearing the most in the results, with some randomness allowing the user to get different results each time. Finally, I started implementing the iTunes file which handles interactions with iTunes, gets tracks depending on the input of the search bar and stores in the database the 30sec preview, but I haven’t finished that yet. I had trouble with thinking about how we would do for the recommendations, and also with the song recommendations using last.fm ‘s API, but I finally managed it.

Ava: This week I set up the Spotify API within the repo, as well as helped to brainstorm some alternatives for other APIs to supplement the loss of Deezer as an API option, (Deezer isn’t currently accepting new use of their API at this time). I’ve also reviewed some PRs for the recommendation engine, specifically Louis’s preliminary algorithm for the n songs presented to the user. So far, I’ve learned more about setting up APIs and determining which characteristics of APIs we value more for our app, like song tagging features or a pre-build recommendation algorithm. I was somewhat stuck initially when setting up the Spotify API since when building I encountered some routing and file issues that interacted with the new API but I was able to resolve them after watching a couple video walkthroughs.
