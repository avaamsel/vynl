#### **UI/UX:**

**Deliverable**: Wireframes for Swiping UI (left/right gestures, song info); Annotated user interaction flow 

* Begin creating reusable design components (button, cards, swipe animations)  
* Design Swiping Feature UI (Tinder-style cards, song info, gesture hints, skip/like animations).  
* Specify transitions and interaction timing.

#### **Frontend:**

**Deliverable:** Log in/sign up page fully functional

* Implement seed song selection UI, “Add seed song” button.  
* Implement account setup and log-in page.

#### **Backend:**

**Deliverable:** auth endpoints working (users can log in, logout, and view saved playlists)

* Set up user account endpoints, enable user sessions, implement email/password login, configure user session tokens

### Progress and issues: 

#### **UI/UX:**

Aliyah: This week, I worked on the interactive prototype for the Welcome and Sign In / Log In pages, focusing on making the gradient look smoother and more consistent with the rest of the design. I also started creating the wireframe for the Upload page, which was a bit tricky since our team had to think carefully about how users would move through the page to make sure it was easy to use and accessible. We tried out different layouts and ideas to make uploading simple for everyone. I also made the swiping wireframes for when users want to like or dislike a song and worked on showing how the album art would spin on the vinyl during playback. Overall, this week was about improving how the app looks and feels while keeping it user-friendly.

Lillian: This week I finished up the interactive prototype/wireframe. We had an idea to have a spinning vinyl graphic on our welcome page. Initially, we had given up since there were external platforms we needed to use. But I went back and was able to figure it out using an MP4 for the spinning effect. As a team we decided that a gradient background would look better with the spinning vinyl so I had to go back and make the spinning vinyl have no background. I was unable to find a method that would work with Figma but I found a solution using React Native. I also learned how to smooth gradients and import fonts. Overall, this week I learned a lot\!

Vicky: This week, I focused on designing the main dashboard page for our app using Figma, as well as creating the UI for the Design Swiping Feature, which includes Tinder-style cards, song information, and skip/like animations. I successfully added interactions to the prototype, making the user flow more engaging and intuitive. I also developed a reusable color palette, font template, and button components to maintain visual consistency throughout the app. What worked well was setting up the component system early, which made iteration faster. I originally had trouble with aligning all the icons evenly, but then I learned how to group components on Figma and align them evenly. I’m still having some difficulty adding the swipe animations smoothly with user gestures, and am stuck on optimizing the card stack behavior to ensure it feels fluid and responsive. 

#### **Frontend:**

Aliyah: This week, I cloned the GitHub repository to begin building the Expo app. After getting the project environment properly configured, I focused on implementing the Sign In / Sign Up page as one of the first major frontend components. I was able to successfully code the structure and layout for the page, making sure it followed the overall theme and color scheme of our app. However, since Figma was temporarily down, I couldn’t fully match the original design created by the UI/UX team. I plan to refine the details once Figma becomes accessible again.

One of the biggest challenges I encountered was running the Expo app in sync with the new code I wrote.

Lillian: This week I used the Expo app feature for the first time. I worked on using React Native to make a vinyl graphic spin. It’s my first time using Expo so I had to spend some time getting familiar with it. It was also my first time animating something with React Native. I got stuck at making the vinyl spin smoothly and appear with no background. I also had to fix up some of the code so that I can start the login and sign up implementation. I struggled with Expo opening correctly on my phone. But that seems to be an Expo issue since it would work once I retried multiple times. Overall, my biggest obstacle was ensuring the codebase worked on the Expo mobile app. 

Louis: For this week I worked mainly on the log in/sign up page. The pages seem to work, although I haven’t done the link to any backend or database to check if the account already exists or not and if the credentials are correct, but I developed it such that the link will be easy to make. We finally decided with the frontend team not to do the searching songs section because we would like the backend to be started before starting on it, since there will be a lot of requests between the frontend and the Deezer API. I still worked on the upload page before the selection one. I didn’t face any major problems, although the project structure/dependencies had to be fixed.

#### **Backend:**

Zack: This week I worked on cleaning up the git repo. Firstly I got expo installed and working on my computer, being able to run our app on my phone. I then fixed our gitignore to ignore generated files and deleted files from the repo that should be ignored. I added some old templates for GitHub issues to the repo and reorganized the folder layout to allow for API endpoints to be easily added. Currently still working on fixing some issues that arose due to this though. Additionally, I started to add Supabase secrets to our project and added the Supabase library to interact with the database.

Louis: This week I worked on fixing dependencies and Expo Go setup problems. I also tried to rethink the design and how the project folders were structured. I learned how to read and solve some errors related to running expo. I also worked with the backend team on our database scheme.

Ava: This week I primarily worked on solidifying our app’s architecture and the relationship between our proposed components. I also helped ensure that the React Native and Expo Go codebase was functional and able to be opened by all of the members who will be working with it. I learned about resolving build errors, especially in our case where the Node.js version wasn’t compatible with our version of Expo. When first encountering the build errors, I was a bit stuck but was able to figure it out with joint efforts from Zack and Louis.

### Plans and goals for the next week: 

#### **UI/UX Goals:**

**Deliverable:** Create export flow wireframes from connecting to Spotify account to exporting a playlist to Spotify 

Lillian: 

* Work on export wireframe page to connect to Spotify sign-in (2 days)

Aliyah and Vicky: 

* Work on the export frame from the playlist wireframe (3 days)
