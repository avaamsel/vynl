## Progress and issues: 

#### **UI/UX:**

Aliyah: This week, I focused on implementing the swipe component of the app in preparation for the beta release. Because of this, I wasn’t able to complete the wireframes for export, but my main priority was ensuring the select and swipe screens were fully integrated and working.

Lillian: This week I had to prioritize the swiping feature for the beta release. So, I did not get around to making the export wireframes. Since I am on frontend as well, I worked on making the select songs and swiping match the UI. 

Vicky: This week I focused on implementing the swiping feature’s confirmation page and saved playlist screen in preparation for the beta release. I did not get to create the export wireframes yet, as they were not a high priority for the beta release at the moment. From this experience, I learned that although they’re are lots of features that are good for the app, for a MVP, you should always prioritize getting the core bare-bones feature implemented and functioning before adding the additional bonus features.  

#### **Frontend:**

Aliyah: This week, I helped complete the song selection screen by implementing ten songs with their names and album covers. Initially, the search function displayed all results regardless of the query, but I was able to debug the issue and add a “Liked” section at the bottom so users can easily see the two songs they’ve chosen. I also connected this screen to the swiping screen, which now displays ten songs and tracks how many the user passes or accepts. While the screen works as intended, it’s currently lagging due to the time it takes to load album photos, something I plan to improve next week. Overall, I learned a lot about building a smooth front-end navigation experience and ensuring users can move seamlessly through the app.

Lillian: This week I worked on finishing the select songs and swiping features for the beta release. I changed “upload” to “select” songs since it’s less confusing for users. I added the search icon to the search bar for when users select songs. I learned that I expo has its own set of icons to use which ended up matching the UI’s icon pretty well. I helped Aliyah connect the selecting songs with the swiping feature. I also fixed smaller things like adjusting the back button, help button, and centering the vinyl icons for the swiping portion. Issues like the music sound preview and laggy swiping should be resolved once we connect the backend. 

Vicky:  This week, I worked on connecting the dashboard screen with all the navigation screens from the select songs to the navigation screen to the user profile login screen. I helped debug issues such as merge conflicts amongst my teammates, and helped create the confirmation page for after the user finishes swiping, it creates a playlist for them that they can name and save. I also fixed smaller design parts from my previous week to match the original UI design such as the font alignment, background color palette, and navigation bar sync between all screens. As of now, from a developer or user’s perspective, the set up of running our program, there’s a lot of packages here and there that they need to install, so in order to address this, my plan is to create a file that has these dependencies and packages pre-installed so they don’t need to type all these steps into the terminal. I also learned this week how to connect MCP between Figma and my Cursor, so I can turn my Figma design into actionable code faster. 

#### **Backend:**

Zack: This week, I worked on fixing the github testing workflow and started to set up the playlist API endpoints. I tested how the frontend and backend code will make requests to each other and pass authorization information about the user. Also researched into how Supabase and Expo handles cookies and determined that we had to go another route with storing access tokens.

Louis: This week, we had to finish some stuff to prepare the beta version presentation. To do so, I helped working on the backend server GET and PUT endpoints, implementing a method to get a client on the server side that we would call for each endpoint. I also improved the last fm api recommendations and the fetch song from iTunes provider. Finally, I worked on the types we would use (Song, Playlist, User,...). The biggest issue I had this week was with the backend logic. In fact, I had never worked with it, so understanding at first was not easy, especially since we are using Expo and there are some differences with usual backend endpoints. 

Ava: This week, I helped to create Jest tests for our main recommendation algorithm as well as service tests for Last.fm, especially in regard to making sure songs are present within Last.fm’s database. I learned more about creating using tests, especially when they utilize APIs, like Last.fm’s in our case, as well as figuring out appropriate tests that will aid in our development. In general, I came across the general issues when learning how to write unit tests with a testing service that is still somewhat unfamiliar to me and I hope to improve as a I continue to work more with Jest.
