### October 13, 2025 

## Last week’s goals (Week 2 \- Basic Set Up and Wireframe):

UI/UX:

**Deliverable**: Low-fidelity user flow diagrams, clickable prototype for Landing \+ Seed Song Upload \+ Login, Sitemap for all screens, Initial sketches / low-fidelity wireframes for MVP (P0 only)

* Research \+ define 2-3 user personas.  
* Create **low-fi wireframes for Landing Page / Dashboard**.  
* Focus specifically on **Seed Song Upload UI element**:  
  * “Add seed song” button placement, song selection flow, and loading states.  
* Define initial color palette, typography, and iconography.

Frontend: 

**Deliverable:** Initialized project with working environment.

* Set up the React Native project, configure version control, and integrate the basic folder structure and dependencies. 

Backend: 

**Deliverable:** backend environment initialized, ER diagram, working database connection, automatic deploying and testing on GitHub.

* Establish backend foundation and environment (setting up the database, defining schemas) in GitHub. Also set up CI/CD for the backend code.

### Progress and issues: 

**PM:** 

Vicky: I organized and led our weekly Friday all-team meeting, ensuring that each subgroup (UI/UX, frontend, and backend) shared updates on progress and blockers. From this approach, I learned it worked well in fostering open communications, timeline awareness of all due dates, and collective problem solving, as when a team member had questions, another team member could help answer them as well. I also created a weekly to-do task for each team member, shared a resource page on Discord, and developed a detailed project schedule to keep everyone on track and aware of upcoming deadlines and goals. My main challenge was finding a good meeting location for everyone in the Allen building because some have capacity restraints, and some meeting rooms couldn’t be booked a week in advance, which caused study rooms we were supposed to meet in to be booked. I’m still working on communicating schedule changes as well as reminding a day before our meeting time to avoid late or no-shows. 

**UI/UX:**

Aliyah: I created a color palette, app logo, and selected text fonts for our app\! This was my first time developing a color palette for a UI/UX project. I also faced some challenges designing the logo. I wanted it to remain minimalistic while still expressing the app’s identity through its shape, color balance, and simplicity.

Lillian: I worked on making color palettes, a wireframe, and a clickable prototype. When making the color palettes, I considered what colors are often associated with music and how our colors can be different/similar. I learned how to make wireframes and a clickable prototype. I struggled a bit with the prototype since it’s my first time using Figma for it. I started playing around with Figma for a mobile app prototype. Currently, I am stuck on finishing up the prototype since I was confused about the division of work. 

Vicky: I focused on the visual design direction for our app. I compiled five color palette options and designed the app icon for all team members to choose during the all-team meeting on Fridays. Through this process, I learned how important it is to balance creativity with usability, especially when selecting colors that support accessibility and brand identity. However, I encountered time management challenges because I’m slightly behind on developing the landing page dashboard and seed song upload UI element due to a misunderstanding about the weekly status report deadline. The course website said Wednesday nights, but an Ed post mentioned due dates on Monday nights instead. Although this setback caused some stress, I plan to complete both designs by Wednesday, Oct 15, so the frontend team can begin implementation without further delay. 

**Frontend:**

Aliyah: In terms of front-end development, I have not started coding the front-end portion as the ui/ux wireframe and low-fidelity prototype need to be completed.

Lillian: This week I worked with the UI/UX team to make the wireframe and prototype so that the frontend can use it for next week. I did not start frontend work yet since the project environment was being set up with the backend team and the ui/ux team needed to deliver a wireframe and prototype. 

Louis: With the backend team, I helped setting up the React Native environment and brainstormed a lot about the project structure for the frontend. I learned a lot about the structure we were going to use because I never used React Native before.

**Backend:**

Zack: I started to set up the database account and designing the database schema. Currently we are still in the planning stage of designing the schema for the database but have a pretty good idea of what it will look like and what tables will be needed. What I learned about this week was database schemas for lists of data. Since I haven’t taken a database class before it was my first time needing to work with a database that used list of elements.

Louis: I helped on setting up React Native (Expo). I also helped think about API’s we were going to use with the issues we were facing (for example the preview not available with Spotify web API), what database we would use, and tried to run the repo on my computer to be sure everything worked correctly.

Ava – I worked on setting up React Native within the repo, I initially had some difficulties with setting up React Native (primarily issues with Ruby and Cocoapods) since I initially didn’t set it up using Expo Go. Once I redid the repo with Expo Go everything went smoothly. I also made sure I could run the repo for both Android and iOS as well. From this, I learned how to set up coding environments for teams and how to properly write README.md for a software project. 

### Plans and goals for the next week: 

**UI/UX Goals:**

To address the fall behind schedule issue, the UI/UX is meeting this Thursday for three hours in person, to get back on track and even ahead on our design goal for next week.

**Deliverable**: Wireframes for Swiping UI (left/right gestures, song info)

Lillian: 

* Begin creating reusable design components for each listed (button, cards, swipe animations) (2 days)

Aliyah and Vicky: 

* Design **Swiping Feature UI** (Tinder-style cards, song info, gesture hints, skip/like animations). (3 days)  
* Specify transitions and interaction timing.(1 day)

UI/UX all team members: 

* Annotate user interaction flow  (about 1-2 days)

**Frontend Goals:**

**Deliverable:** Functional seed song upload system, with the user can select at least 5 songs and can create an account, and connect to it

Louis \+ Ava:

* Implement seed song selection UI “Add seed song” button (2 days)


Aliyah:

* Implement account setup and login page (3 days)

All team members:
