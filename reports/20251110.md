## Progress and issues: 

#### **UI/UX:**

Aliyah: This week, I worked on designing the Multi-Platform Export and Account Linking UI, creating layouts for how users will connect their various music streaming accounts. I also drafted early concepts for Social Features, including screens for adding friends, viewing their playlists, and the dashboard that shows shared music activity.

Lillian: I am working on creating the export wireframe. I hope to finish this soon so that frontend can implement it. So far, I’ve made a simple draft in Figma. I am struggling with how to visually make it such as if export should be a simple pop up or a whole separate page.

Vicky: This week, I worked on creating the export feature on Figma, specifically the confirmation page after the playlist is created. I’m also working on drafting the party mode feature, where users can add songs to a party playlist by swiping before the party so the host can accommodate everyone’s song preferences. 

#### **Frontend:**

Aliyah:  This week, I worked on refining the seed-song replacement and removal interactions to improve the user experience. I helped implement the updated dashboard stats display and worked on improving UI interactions based on beta feedback. I learned that small details like button hit areas and visual feedback are crucial.

Lillian: This week I worked on revising the user guide specifically the modifying playlist case. I’m rewriting it so that it’s from the perspective of a finished app. Our original user guide was similar to what the developer should’ve been. I’m working on the export wireframe so that frontend can implement it. 

Vicky: This week, I worked on revising the user guide on how to create a playlist part. Currently, I’m waiting on the backend to finish up their endpoints, and UI/UX to finish with the export feature design. While I’m waiting for the other subteams to finish, I’ve just been cleaning up our repo, such as deleting unused branches and resolving merge conflicts, and designing placeholders for the export features after the playlist is created. 

#### **Backend:**

Zack: I spent most of my time this week working on the playlist endpoints and going over database design making sure it still makes sense with our future goals. For the endpoints it took a lot more time than I expected, spending around \~10 hours last week working on them. I also dealt with a package version issue last week that came up. The endpoints aren’t fully finished but the main ones that we thought were going to take the longest are done. I didn’t get around to adding test cases to the endpoints but I did manually test them.

Louis: This week I mainly worked on finishing the backend endpoints. I implemented different endpoints for the songs and the playlist, and refined the endpoint regarding the recommendation. I also worked on refining the structure and applying it to all the backend we had already done. I had some issues with some endpoints and links with the database, but I managed to fix it easily.

Ava: This week I worked on search features and recommendation features, specifically when a user is being displayed songs to swipe. We had come across the issue that the user will only be displayed the first 10 generated by the algorithm in the exact order they were pulled, so we decided to work on having it be somewhat randomized as well as less repetitive. I came across some small issues with navigating some of the existing code written for search, but in the end I managed to implement the changes I wanted to. I learned a bit more about modifying and improving existing code within our codebase as well as creating personalized algorithms.
