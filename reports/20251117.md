## Progress and issues: 

#### **UI/UX:**

Aliyah: I worked alongside Lillian on coming up with what the export wireframe should be like. It was pretty simple to figure out how we wanted the export screen to look like so we ended up going with users being able to export when they view their playlists, rather than just asking when they immediately created one\!

Lillian: I finished most of the export wireframe but I’m not focusing on export because Ava has made progress with it. I chose to work on the stretch feature which is the party mode. I focused on making the wireframe for toggling on/off for the party feature. This was pretty straight forward since there are many toggle icons for me to use. 

Vicky: This week, I worked on creating the wireframe for our stretch goal, which is the party mode feature. I worked on mainly the main dashboard screen wireframe where users can either select ‘Host a Party Playlist’ or ‘Join a Party Playlist’, and then also the next screen where the host will create the playlist information to generate a 6 digit code for the party members to use to join their party playlist.    

#### **Frontend:**

Aliyah: This week, there has been a shift in priority in frontend, so I mainly focused on implementation in UI/UX\!

Lillian: This week I had to focus on finishing the wireframe for the party feature’s toggle on/off so that frontend can implement it.

Vicky: This week, I revise some bugs on the frontend side such as the create new playlist button, and also updating the versions on the package-json file. Currently, still trying to refine the user interface such as making sure all contents do not overlap with the navigation bar, and making the export to Spotify with less steps to navigate to the login part. Right now, I’m stuck on the part where I’m trying to login, it’s giving me an INVALID URL after I try to log into Spotify, so trying to figure out this week how to debug this. 

#### **Backend:**

Zack: I finished the playlist APIs and did some manual testing with them to make sure they worked as expected. There were some fixes that needed to be done.Along with this I updated the API documentation to include example requests and responses. Additionally I started to add the test cases for testing backend endpoints. Currently what I have gotten done is setting up a test database that is automatically connected to when running tests and allowing for admin access to clear the database between every test. I also worked on planning out our stretch features. Figuring out what new endpoints we will need and how it will sync data between users.

Louis: This week, I worked mainly on linking frontend and backend, which took much more time then what I expected. In fact, I had to create many hooks for the backend calls, and completely rethink and rework some frontend files which were not thought to integrate the backend. I had many small issues on the authentication side with how to store the authentication token securely, but I managed to find a solution which was secure and wasn’t forcing the user to login every time they opened the app. 

Ava: For this week I primarily focused on exports, so I intended to tackle exporting to Apple Music and Youtube Music, *however,* Vicky had commented on my Spotify export PR that there were some severity issues I should fix and when I went to do that I encountered this error: “\[runtime not ready\]: Invariant Violation: TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing(..) : 'PlatformConstants' could not be found. Verify that a module by this name is registered in the native binary. Bridgeless mode: true. TurboModule interop: false. Modules loaded: {"NativeModules": \[\], "TurboModules": \[\], "NotFound" : \["NativePerformanceObserverCxx", "NativePe rformanceCxx", "PlatformConstants" 1}”. I’m having a lot of trouble finding any conclusive fixes for it, I sent a message in the Discord and no one knew how to fix it, I copied over functional package.json and package-lock.json files from working branches and still nothing, so I can’t make a lot of progress on exports until this issue is fixed.
